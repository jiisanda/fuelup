# fuelup

## Project Requirements

* Build an API that takes inputs of start and finish location both within the USA
* Return a map of the route along with optimal location to fuel up along the route -- optimal mostly means cost effective based on fuel prices
* Assume the vehicle has a maximum range of 500 miles so multiple fuel ups might need to be displayed on the route
* Also return the total money spent on fuel assuming the vehicle achieves 10 miles per gallon
* Use the attached file for a list of fuel prices 
* Find a free API yourself for the map and routing
